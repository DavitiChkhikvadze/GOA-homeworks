        <h2>inline elements</h2>
        <p>inline elements are elements, that are written inside or outside the container tags,
             which don't hold up the entire space of line.
              for example, the bold, the italic, the input, the label,
               the button and the other tags are inline, because they do not hold up entire line space </p>
        <p>block elements are elements, which hold up the entire space of line. for example paragraph, head 1-6, and etc are block elements</p>
