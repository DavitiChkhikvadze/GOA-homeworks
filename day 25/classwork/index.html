    <h1><strong>My favourite movie - Gran Turismo</strong></h1>
    <img src="gran turismo movie.jpg" width="500">
    <p><i>Gran Turismo</i> is movie about <b>Racing</b> and <b>success.</b><br>
    it is about a gamer boy named <i>Jann Mardenborurgh</i>, 
    whose dream came true to be professional Racer. <br>
    At first he played game named <b>Gran Turismo</b> with gamimg steering wheel.<br>
He was really good in it and knew car parts very well.<br> 
One day, He decided to apply for racing competition, and he finished on 1st place. <br>
then, after some training, he raced to join new <u>Nissan Racing Academy</u>,
 and he won there by millimeters. <br> 
 after that, there was another race for <i>FIA license</i>, which meant that if he won,
  he could race against proffesionals, or even <b>Le Mans 24 Hour Racing</b>.<br>
He was talented and experienced, everyone was amazed by his possibilities.<br>
one day, he managed to win Le Mans race for the first time ever.<br>
determination and enthusiasm helped him to reach his goal.<br>
 He had amazing experience in every way: win, lose, accident, or champion.<br>
 The thing I like in this movie the most is hard work and willpower of my favourite character,
  Jann Mardenborurgh and his coach, Jack Salter.<br>
   Jann didnt listen to anyone and it was really good thing he did,
    because thats how he managed to reach success. </p>
